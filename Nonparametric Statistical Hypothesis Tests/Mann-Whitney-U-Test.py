"""
Tests whether the distributions of two independent samples are equal or not.

Assumptions

Observations in each sample are independent and identically distributed (iid).
Observations in each sample can be ranked.
Interpretation

H0: the distributions of both samples are equal.
H1: the distributions of both samples are not equal.
